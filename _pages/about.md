👋🏻 I am a PhD student at University of Padova, working in the [Quantum Information and Matter group](https://quantum.dfa.unipd.it/) under the supervision of Prof. Simone Montangero.

I'm still looking around, but I focus mostly on **quantum error correction** and large-scale **quantum simulations** with optimized numerical methods. 
I enjoy working on **quantum compilation** too, despite my brief experience with it.

Aside from research, I wander in the realms of Linux kernels and road bikes 🚴🏻.

I use Fedora btw.

## 🌐 in this website

This website is a portfolio dedicated to academic work, though I plan to post more stuff about my free time in the future. 
Check out for instance some [random coding](/coding/).

## ➡️ in my world line
* **thesis** at the [Quantum Optimization group](https://www.uibk.ac.at/th-physik/quantum-optimization/index.html.en), *University of Innsbruck*
* **internship** at [CERN Quantum Technology Initiative](https://quantum.cern/), as openlab summer student 2023
* MSc in Physics, *University of Padova*. Core lectures: quantum information, quantum hardware, quantum cryptography and security, computational physics, neural networks and deep learning.
